## 🧹 CLEANUP COMPLETED - SMART PILLAR DISCOVERY SYSTEM

### ✅ **REDUNDANT COMPONENTS REMOVED:**

**1. Legacy Pillar System:**
- ❌ `src/components/SixPillars/PillarDashboard.tsx` (replaced by ModularPillarDashboard)
- ❌ `src/components/SixPillars/PillarAssessmentForm.tsx` (replaced by ModularPillarAssessment)
- ❌ `src/hooks/useSixPillars.ts` (replaced by useSixPillarsModular)
- ❌ `src/types/sixPillars.ts` (replaced by sixPillarsModular)

**2. Obsolete Journey Components:**

- ❌ `src/components/Progress/ProgressDashboard.tsx` (unused)

**3. Dead Code Cleanup:**

- ✅ Updated `EnhancedDashboard.tsx` to redirect to new Five Pillars system
- ✅ Clean navigation flow from Six Pillars → GuidedPillarDiscovery

### ✅ **CONSISTENT UI PATTERNS:**
- All pillar selection now uses the intelligent recommendation system
- Unified dashboard navigation between different user roles
- Consistent component naming (Modular* for new system)
- Streamlined import paths and dependencies

### ✅ **PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:**
- Removed duplicate functionality between old and new pillar systems
- Eliminated unused hooks and type definitions
- Cleaner component hierarchy with intelligent recommendations first

### 🎯 **RESULT:**
- **Cleaner codebase** with no redundant pillar selection systems
- **Better UX** with intelligent recommendations guiding users
- **Consistent architecture** using only the modern modular system
- **Future-proof** foundation for further development

The system now provides a seamless flow: **Welcome Assessment → AI Analysis → Intelligent Pillar Recommendations → Guided Selection → Assessment**

All roles (user, coach, admin) now use the same consistent, modern UI patterns! 🚀
