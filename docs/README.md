## ‚ö° QUICK START FOR DEVELOPMENT TEAMS

### 1. CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED (Immediate)
```bash
# Phase 1: Address Critical Issues
- Consolidate dashboard architecture (see SYSTEM_AUDIT_REPORT.md)
- Standardize terminology (see TERMINOLOGY_STANDARDIZATION.md)  
- Sync role-based data access across all dashboards
```

### 2. SYSTEM REPLICATION (Complete Blueprint)
```bash
# Technology Stack
- Frontend: React 18.3.1 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Auth + Storage)
- AI Integration: OpenAI + vector embeddings + memory system
- Design System: shadcn/ui with semantic color tokens

# Key Implementation Files
- Database Schema: DATABASE_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md
- Edge Functions: EDGE_FUNCTIONS_GUIDE.md  
- Frontend Components: FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- System Architecture: ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md
```

### 3. CORE METHODOLOGY: Six Pillars
1. **Sj√§lvomv√•rdnad (Self Care)** - Personal health and wellbeing
2. **Kompetenser (Skills)** - Professional skill development
3. **Talang (Talent)** - Natural abilities and strengths  
4. **Varum√§rke (Brand)** - Personal branding and reputation
5. **Ekonomi (Economy)** - Financial management and growth
6. **√ñppna Sp√•ret (Open Track)** - Custom development areas
