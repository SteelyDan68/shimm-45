### ‚úÖ PHASE 2: CODE CLEANUP (100% COMPLETE)
1. **Dead Code Elimination**
   - Removed deprecated `RoleSpecificDashboards.tsx` (652 lines)
   - Resolved all TODO comments with proper implementations
   - Created `src/utils/cleanupDeadCode.ts` for maintenance tracking

2. **Architecture Optimization**
   - Extracted shared constants to centralized location
   - Standardized component naming conventions
   - Optimized import statements and dependencies

### ‚úÖ PHASE 3: SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT (100% COMPLETE)
