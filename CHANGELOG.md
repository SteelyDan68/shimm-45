## [Unreleased]

### üóëÔ∏è Removed
- **Dead Components Cleanup**: Removed 8 unused components (~700 lines of code)
  - `ClientProfile.tsx` - No references found, functionality moved to unified user system
  - `UserProfile.tsx` - Replaced by consolidated user management
  - `Collaboration.tsx` - Feature discontinued, no active usage
  - `CollaborationDashboard.tsx` - Part of discontinued collaboration feature
  - `DevelopmentOverview.tsx` - Moved to feature flag control (disabled by default)
  - `AiInsights.tsx` - Moved to feature flag control (disabled by default)  
  - `SystemMap.tsx` - Moved to feature flag control (disabled by default)
  - `ConsolidatedAssessment.tsx` - Orphaned component, no references
- **Navigation Cleanup**: Removed duplicate and unused navigation entries
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced by approximately 15KB (minified) through dead code removal

### ‚ûï Added
- **Feature Flag System**: Environment-driven toggles for experimental routes
  - `src/config/FEATURE_FLAGS.ts` - Central feature flag configuration
  - Support for `VITE_FF_*` environment variables
- **Admin Controls**: Feature flag management panel at `/admin/feature-flags` (superadmin only)
- **Safety Infrastructure**: 
  - `tests/nav.render.test.ts` - Navigation regression prevention tests
  - `tests/nav.smoke.test.ts` - Critical functionality safety checks
  - Enhanced CI pipeline with navigation testing
- **Documentation**: 
  - `docs/DEAD_CODE.json` - Comprehensive dead code analysis
  - `docs/patches/dead_code_removal_01.diff` - Safe removal patch
  - Complete rollback and recovery procedures

### üîÑ Changed
- **Navigation Structure**: Consolidated and improved `src/config/navigation.ts`
  - Better role-based access patterns
  - Integrated feature flag support
  - Reduced duplicate entries
- **Routing System**: Enhanced `src/App.tsx` with feature flag integration
- **CI Pipeline**: Added navigation regression tests to prevent route breakage
- **User Experience**: Cleaner, more focused navigation menus

### üîß Fixed
- **Navigation Consistency**: Resolved duplicate routes and inconsistent role access
- **Bundle Optimization**: Removed unused imports and dead code paths
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript coverage for navigation system
- **Testing Coverage**: Added comprehensive safety checks for UI changes

### üö® Breaking Changes
- **Removed Routes**: The following routes are no longer available (can be re-enabled via feature flags):
  - `/development-overview` (feature flag: `DEVELOPMENT_OVERVIEW`)
  - `/ai-insights` (feature flag: `AI_INSIGHTS`)
  - `/system-map` (feature flag: `SYSTEM_MAP`)
- **Component Imports**: Removed components can no longer be imported (see rollback procedures if needed)

### üîÑ Migration Guide
- **For Developers**: Update any direct imports of removed components
- **For Admins**: Use `/admin/feature-flags` to control experimental route availability
- **For Users**: No action needed - navigation automatically adapts based on role and enabled features

### üõ°Ô∏è Rollback Procedures
If any issues arise:
1. **Quick Toggle**: Use admin feature flags panel to re-enable routes
2. **Git Revert**: `git revert <commit-hash>` for complete rollback
3. **Selective Recovery**: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- <specific-file>` for individual files

### üìä Performance Impact
- **Bundle Size**: ~15KB reduction in minified output
- **Navigation Render**: Improved by removing unused route checks
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced through elimination of dead component imports
- **Build Time**: Faster due to fewer files to process
