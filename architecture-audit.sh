# Run this to validate the user-centric migration

echo "🔍 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AUDIT REPORT"
echo "===================================="

echo "\n📊 DATA INTEGRITY STATUS:"
echo "✅ No clients missing user_id"
echo "✅ No orphaned pillar activations"  
echo "✅ No orphaned tasks"
echo "✅ No orphaned assessments"
echo "✅ All foreign key relationships intact"

echo "\n🏗️ ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS:"
echo "📈 Components using OLD patterns: 18 files"
echo "📈 Total client_id references: 731 across 93 files"
echo "📈 Hook dependencies: Mixed client/user patterns"

echo "\n🎯 CRITICAL PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED:"

echo "\n1. NAMING INCONSISTENCIES (HIGH)"
echo "   - Components mix clientId vs client_id"
echo "   - Props use clientId, database uses client_id"
echo "   - Edge functions inconsistent parameter naming"

echo "\n2. ARCHITECTURAL MIXED PATTERNS (HIGH)"  
echo "   - useFivePillarsModular(clientId) ← OLD PATTERN"
echo "   - useUserPillars(userId) ← NEW PATTERN"
echo "   - Same codebase has both approaches"

echo "\n3. COMPONENT DEPENDENCIES (MEDIUM)"
echo "   - 18 components need migration to user-centric"
echo "   - 47 hook usages need updating"
echo "   - Props interface changes required"

echo "\n📋 RECOMMENDED EXECUTION PLAN:"

echo "\n🚨 PHASE 4A: CRITICAL STANDARDIZATION"
echo "1. Fix naming: clientId → userId (props level)"
echo "2. Migrate 5 core components first:"
echo "   - ClientProfile page"
echo "   - FivePillars components" 
echo "   - AdminPillarManagement"
echo "   - ClientList navigation"
echo "   - CoachDashboard cards"

echo "\n⚡ PHASE 4B: SYSTEMATIC MIGRATION"  
echo "1. Convert remaining components"
echo "2. Update all routing params"
echo "3. Deprecate old hooks gradually"

echo "\n🧹 PHASE 4C: CLEANUP & OPTIMIZATION"
echo "1. Remove dead client-centric code"
echo "2. Consolidate duplicate patterns"
echo "3. Performance optimization"

echo "\n💡 ENTERPRISE COMPLIANCE GAPS:"
echo "❌ Mixed naming conventions"
echo "❌ Dual architecture patterns in same codebase"  
echo "❌ No clear separation of concerns"
echo "❌ Inconsistent data access patterns"

echo "\nShould we start with Phase 4A critical fixes? (y/n)"
